### CANDO Demos <br>
 - #### This repository will aid new users of CANDO get farmiliar with the JupyterLab environment as well as the CANDO software platform.

### Demos include:
 - #### Loading a PDB file, parameterizing an alanine amino acid.
 - #### Basic programming in common-lisp, designing an optimized catalyst.
 - #### Thermodynamic integration from an optimized molecular map using AmberMD pmemd.GPUs.
 - #### Positional analouge scanning from reaction based SMIRKS input.
 - #### PASTI - Positional Analouge Scan with Thermodynamic Integration of output.
