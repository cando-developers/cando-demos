# Amber toolchain test

The molecule in the trifold*.mol2 files is a 35 Angstrom long bundle of six greasy spiroligomers that could be dropped into a membrane to simulate its dynamics.

The goal of this design is to exploit symmetry to create something that is easier to synthesize.  This structure consists of just three spiroligomers and has 3-fold symmetry.

It was built using the Cando chemistry language that I've been working on for the past decade.  The Cando source file builds the three-dimensional structure from a Chemdraw structure.
